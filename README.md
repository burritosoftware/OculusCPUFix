# OculusCPUFix

A simple batch file that runs two commands to disable the `IDLEDISABLE` power setting on startup, just in case Oculus' buggy software forgets to disable it. Based on [this Super User answer](https://superuser.com/questions/1060567/cpu-constantly-at-100-in-task-manager-but-not-in-process-explorer/1061436#1061436).

Simply clone or grab a .zip of the source, extract, and run `UpdateOnStartup.bat` to add it to the Startup folder, or `fix.bat` to run manually.
